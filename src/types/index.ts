// 1. Type allows you to create a union or intersection of types, while interface does not.
// 2. Interface can be merged or augmented using declaration merging, while type cannot.
// 3. Type can be used with mapped types and conditional types, 
//      providing more advanced type manipulation capabilities.
// 4. Interface is more commonly used in the TypeScript community 
//      and is recommended for most cases, especially when defining the shape of an object.
